<p><strong>Intelligent Traditional Chinese Medicine Data Analysis System</strong></p>
<p>Intelligent Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Group, Research and Development</p>
<p><strong>TL：</strong> Sep 2020-Jul 2022</p>
<p><strong>Tasks：</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The project uses data mining algorithms for clustering and association analysis of TCM prescriptions; deep learning is used for data training of TCM text datasets to achieve text recognition and entity linking functions. By using the complex system entropy clustering pattern mining algorithm, the drug pairs with similar drug properties are filtered out, so that the difference of the correlation coefficients of each drug pair in all the clustered pairs becomes smaller and the success rate of obtaining new prescriptions increases.</li>
  <li>The association analysis uses the Apriori algorithm to obtain the association between drugs based on the prescriptions and output the set of drugs that meet the confidence threshold. Frequency analysis counted and ranked the frequency of single drugs, drug pairs and triads in the prescriptions.</li>
  <li>Named entity recognition of Chinese medicine manuals: The ALBERT_BiLSTM_CRF model is used to iteratively train the Chinese medicine manual data, save the model as an hdf5 file, and then perform entity recognition on the input text. The accuracy of this project reaches 98% and possesses good results.</li>
  <li>Named entity linking: entity linking and entity disambiguation operations are performed based on the entities identified by named entities. Mapping the entities in the entity library and returning the knowledge graph.</li>
